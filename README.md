## NFT Mint 🎨

This project is a NFT minting platform developed with a focus on understanding the web3 environment. The main objective was to explore and comprehend the functioning of blockchain technologies and NFTs, prioritizing the implementation of web3 functionalities over conventional web2 development practices.

### About NFTs 🖼️

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique and indivisible tokens that represent digital or physical assets on the blockchain. In this project, we implemented the functionality of minting NFTs. 

The NFTs minted in this project can be traded on OpenSea's testnet marketplace. 🌊
