## NFT Mint 🎨

This project is a NFT minting platform developed with a focus on understanding the web3 environment. The main objective was to explore and comprehend the functioning of blockchain technologies and NFTs, prioritizing the implementation of web3 functionalities over conventional web2 development practices.

**Note: This project was created solely for educational and learning purposes. It is not intended for production use.**

### Technologies Used 🛠️

- React ⚛️
- Next.js 🔲
- Solidity 💎
- Web3.js 🌐
- Avalanche Network (Testnet) ❄️
- MetaMask 🦊

### Smart Contract 📝

The smart contract for this project is deployed on the Avalanche Testnet and can be viewed [here](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xf33b1b4Cb3afe064291d365534AB8822eE7BdD08/contract/43113/code).

### Live Demo 🌐

You can access the live demo of this project deployed on IPFS through Fleek [here](https://hollow-russia-screeching.on-fleek.app).

### About NFTs 🖼️

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique and indivisible tokens that represent digital or physical assets on the blockchain. In this project, we implemented the functionality of minting NFTs. 

The NFTs minted in this project can be traded on OpenSea's testnet marketplace. 🌊

### Minting Requirements 💰

To mint NFTs on this platform, you'll need AVAX tokens on the Avalanche Testnet. You can obtain test AVAX tokens for free through these faucets:

- [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/)
- [Core Faucet](https://core.app/tools/testnet-faucet/?subnet=c&token=c)

Make sure to have your MetaMask wallet connected to the Avalanche Testnet before requesting tokens.

### Future Improvements 🚀

The project has several opportunities for technical improvements:

1. Infrastructure 🏗️

   - Implementation of integration testing pipeline
   - Implementation of end-to-end tests
   - Automated deployment pipeline

2. Interface 💻
   - Replacement of alerts with toast notifications
   - Implementation of confirmation modals for important actions
   - Enhancement of user experience for different application states
