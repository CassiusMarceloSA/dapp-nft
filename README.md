## NFT Mint

This project is a NFT minting platform developed with a focus on understanding the web3 environment. The main objective was to explore and comprehend the functioning of blockchain technologies and NFTs, prioritizing the implementation of web3 functionalities over conventional web2 development practices.

### Technologies Used

- React
- Next.js
- Solidity
- Web3.js
- Avalanche Network (Testnet)
- MetaMask

### Smart Contract

The smart contract for this project is deployed on the Avalanche Testnet and can be viewed [here](https://testnet.snowtrace.io/address/0xf33b1b4Cb3afe064291d365534AB8822eE7BdD08/contract/43113/code).

### About NFTs

NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique and indivisible tokens that represent digital or physical assets on the blockchain. In this project, we implemented the functionality of minting, buying, and selling NFTs in a decentralized environment.

### Future Improvements

The project has several opportunities for technical improvements:

1. Infrastructure

   - Implementation of integration testing pipeline
   - Implementation of end-to-end tests
   - Automated deployment pipeline

2. Interface
   - Replacement of alerts with toast notifications
   - Implementation of confirmation modals for important actions
   - Enhancement of user experience for different application states
